# IoT Based Accident Detection System
An IoT solution to detect accidents in automobiles, and to ensure timely help by alerting centralized emergency center.

## Working
When an automobile meets with an accident, the inbuilt modem detects the collision with 
the help of sensors and immediately send a voice message to the emergency center. 

This message contains GPS co-ordinates of the accident, basic vehicle details such as 
registration no, vehicle type, etc. and owner details. The victim can manually call the 
emergency center, or an automated voice message will be sent by default. 

A camera module will be placed in the automobile, which captures images periodically 
immediately after the accident. These images are then sent to the emergency center, 
which can be used to assess the severity of the accident and decide the suitable medical 
assistance.
